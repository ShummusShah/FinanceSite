                ETF are Exchange traded funds. These are basically a selection of companies all bundled together for you to invest into easily. <br><br>
                When you invest in an ETF, you are investing in many companies at the same time. <br><br>
                They are a 'basket of companies' which are pooled together to invest into. You can then easily invest in an ETF in certain 
                industries, e.g. clean energy or tech companies. Their are also ETF's which are made to track index funds.

An index fund is a fund which tracks the performance of a certain segment of the market.<br><br>
<b>Examples include:<br><br></b>
<ul>
  <li>The FTSE100 which tracks the biggest 100 UK companies </li>
<li>The S&P500 which tracks the largest 500 companies in America</li>
<li>And the Nikkei 225 which tracks the top 225 companies in Japan.</li>
</ul>
Companies named within these indices are often reffered to as 'blue-chip' companies.

              <p><br>
Inflation in it's simplest definition explains how the prices of everyday items increase. <br><br>

The Bank of England has a target of 2% for it's inflation, which basically means that £100 this year, will be worth 2% less next year (if inflation is 2%).<br>
This is because as prices for goods and services go up, your £100 will buy you less than it did the year before. <br><br>
A term which is used in Finance often is 'real terms'. 
'Real' basically means taking into account inflation: to explain this using a simple example; if you made a 5% return on your investments this year, but inflation was 2%, you've made a 3% <b>real return.</b><br><br>
Some people may choose to invest in 'cautious' investments that don't aim for capital growth, but rather have an aim of capital preservation.
These investments tend to not go up in value by huge amounts, but also they are less risky so the odds of you losing money is lower than a more adventurous portfolio. <br><br>
<b>Remember, there is no reward without risk in the financial world!</b>

                ​<br><br>

                Simply put, your net worth (Equity) is equal to what you own (assets) minus what you owe to others (Liabilities).

                PAYE is how most people get paid in the UK, it stands for Pay as you earn, this refers to paying Income Tax as you earn your salary.<br><br>

                 If you have a look at your monthly pay you're likely to see a few deductions. These include National Insurance Contributions (NICs) and your Income Tax. 
                 <br><br> You may also have Student Loan deductions.<br><br>
                 It is important to understand your Tax code to make sure you are paying the right level of tax! See the next point for more on this.

If you are in full time employment, you will have recieved a tax code. If you have a tax code of BR or 0L, this implies that this is for your
second job, or you are paying emergency tax (or this is income from a second job according to HMRC). This means all your income will be taxable at your marginal rate of tax. Also if you have a tax code that ends in W1 or M1, 
this implies you are on an emergency tax code.<br><br>

Most likely you will have a tax code which is 4 digits followed by an L, such at 1258L. If you multiply the number by 10, you will see what your <b>personal allowance</b> is for the tax year.<br><br>

A personal allowance is the amount of money you can earn which is free of Income Tax. Though you may still have to pay National Insurance Contribtuions (NIC).<br><br>
Using the example we had above, a tax code of 1258L would imply you have a personal allowance of £12,580 for the tax year, which runs April 6th to the following April 5th.

              <p><br>
The way the Income tax system works in the UK, your personal allowance is taxed at 0% income tax (free of income tax). The tax you earn past your personal allowance depends on how much you earn in the year.<br><br>

The tax rates are subject to change, but for 2021/22: <br><br>

£12,570 (Personal allowance) is taxed at 0%<br>
Income up to £50,270 is taxed at 20%<br>
Income up to £150,000 is taxed at 40%<br>
& anything over £150,000 is taxed at 45% <br><br>

Being taxed at your marginal rate means that if you were to earn £55,270 in 2021/22, only £5,000 would be taxed at 40%. <br><br>
It is also worth noting, for high earnings (over £100,000) you will probably lose your Personal allowance, but there are ways you <b>might</b> be able to get it back. Which is where you would have to speak to a Financial Planner.

Tax relief applies to pension contributions, charity donations, maintenance payments and time spent working on a ship outside the UK.<br><br>
You can also claim tax relief from investing in high risk investments such as EIS's and SEIS's (basically you get tax relief for investing in start-ups if they qualify)

				<h2>Understanding Mortgages</h2>
				<p> Probably the largest loan you will get in your lifetime, so it's worthwhile knowing the lingo and how they work! </p>

        <section id="faq" class="faq">
          <span class="container" style="padding-top: 0;">
    
            <ul class="faq-list">

                  <p><br>
I'm sure most of you know what a Mortgage is, but just to clarify, it is essentially a loan that is generally taken from a Bank to buy property or Land. <br><br>
There is a 'charge' placed on the property which is the value of the loan, meaning if you were to Sell up, your Loan would have to be repaid (unless you carry it over to a new property!)

                  <p><br>
                  If you are planning on buying a house and taking out a Mortgage, it's always good to get an idea of just how much you can borrow. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Generally banks will loan out up to 90% of the property value. Though you may be able to get a loan of up to 95% of the property value with 'Help to Buy' Schemes.<br><br>
                This means that if you're property was £100,0000, you could potentially borrow up to £95,000, meaning you'd need to put down a £5,000 deposit...

                <br><br> <B>BUT</B> <br>It is important to remember that banks have to lend responsible. Therefore they have to make sure you can afford the repayments of the mortgage.<br>
                <br>To do this, Banks typically lend up to 4.5x your salary (5.5x at some Banks!). Of course your credit history comes into play with this, but generally 4.5x is a good benchmark figure to use. 
                Once you contact a Bank, they'll give you an offer with exactly how much you would be able to loan!
                  </p>

                  <p><br>
    To start the process, the best thing to do is either look online to see where you can get the best rates, or contact a mortgage broker/advisor. It would be useful to have your Payslips and Bank statements (should they be needed)
    to provide for proof of earnings / proof of affordabilitiy. <br><br>

    Once you have contacted a Bank, either of your own back or through a broker, they will advise you on how much you can borrow. They will most likely do this by 
    providing you with an <b>agreement in principle (AIP)</b>.

    Your credit rating is what lets lendors know how likely you are to meet your financial obligations. If you have a high scrore, you would have built up
    a strong credit history in the past; because of this, you are more likely to get lower interest rates on your mortage (so you will pay less interest!) because you are seem as low risk! 
    The banks will be confident that you'd make your payments on time.
  <br><br>
  On the flip side, if you have a lower credit rating, you most likely still be able to get a Mortgage, though because your credit rating is lower, it indicates to lendors
  that you pose higher risk to lend money to, so they will want a higher level of interest paid to them to take that risk on! <b>Remember, there is no reward withour risk!</b>.
  <br><br>Even the banks will accept higher risk in order to recieve higher levels of return!.

When taking out credit, there are 2 main things you should look into. The <b>monthly repayment</b> should be affordable to you and the APR should be checked.<br><br>

APR stands for annual percentage rate; it basically refers to the interest that you will be charged per year for taking out your credit agreement.
Generally speaking, the lower the APR, the lower the amount of interest you will pay over the term of your loan.

An ISA is an Individual Savings Account. Each tax year you get a £20,000 allowance to put into ISAs. <br><br>

A Cash ISA will offer a fixed rate of interest, and will be completely tax free!<br><br>
There are different types of Cash ISAs that are available, some offering instant access meaning you can withdraw your funds at any time & Fixed term Cash ISAs which will generally
offer a higher interest rate, but you cannot withdraw your funds for a certain period of time.

                <div id="faq2" class="collapse" data-bs-parent=".faq-list">
                  <p><br>
A lifetime ISA is a type of Cash ISA - These are designed to help people save for their first home or for retirement. <br><br>
A Lifetime ISA differs to a normal Cash ISA as you can only put a maximum of £4,000 into it each tax year, but the government will give you a 25% bonus on whatever you put in!<br><br>

This £4,000 limit is included in the overall £20,000 ISA limit, so if you put in the full £4,000, you can put in up to an extra £16,000 into other ISAs.

<br><br>
<b>Remember</b> there are more restrictions on accessing your funds with a Lifetime ISA. You can only access your Lifetime ISA funds when you're buying your first home or you reach 60 years old.
You may also be able to access your Lifetime ISA funds if you're diagnosed with a terminal illness.

<br><br>
There are now saving apps, which will save money for you if you still struggle to save. These include the likes of Chip and Plum, these apps connect to your Bank

There's an old saying, 'Don't put all your eggs in one basket' which is fitting when it comes to investing. Ideally you want to have a diversified portfolio!<br><br>
A diversified portfolio will mean that you are invested in a range of industies, from a range of countries, so if there is a huge downturn in a particular market, you have
your assets well spread accross a range of industries so you are less exposed. <br><br>
A good example would be if you the UK went into a huge recession, if you were invested in entirely UK companies, you would most likely lose a lot of money, where as if your 
investments were exposed to a range of countries, a downturn in the UK may improve other countries such as Japanese stocks, so you will be less likely to lose all your money.

- Your investments can go up or down in value, so only invest what you can afford to lose!<br><br>
- There is no reward without risk! So if you want to seek a higher return, you are more than likely going to take on extra risk.<br><br>
- Investments are a long term asset, so you should look to leave your money invested for at least 5 years!<br><br>
- There is no guarantee that you will make money!

There are 2 main types of Pension schemes.<br><br>

1) Defined Benefit Pensions - Also referred to as Final Salary Pensions, where your pensionable income is pre-determined, based on your past employment. You may get a certain percentage of your employment income
throughout your retirement.<br><br>

2) Defined Contributions Pensions - These are more common; with these Pension schemes, you accumulate funds in your pension plan. The amount you retire with is based off how much money you have put into 
your pension over your employment history. Other factors such as the performance of investments within your pension also play a role in the amount you retire with.

Your state pension entitlement is based on the amount of years you have been employed whilst earning above the Lower Earnings Limit.<bR><br>

It's suprising how many people don't know that their Pension will be invested for them; you can phone you pension provider to issue 
a statement which will show your investments. You can also request switches to your investments if you wish to invest in certain funds, e.g. Ethical Investment Funds.

If you wanted to consolodate your Pensions into the one arrangement, this can easily be done. All you will need is the account numbers and pension providers. You may be able to transfer in using 
your online log in with your existing Pension. If not, you can ring your existing Pension provider and enquire how you can consolodate your previous Pensions into it.

If you wish to manage your own Investments and actively pick individual stocks / funds to invest in, you are probably best transferring your pensions into a SIPP.
<br><br>
A SIPP is a Self-Invested Pension Plan, and can be managed fully by you. There are many reputable SIPP providers out there, so have a look online to see what is available. Remember to compare the
ongoing costs for each SIPP provider.
